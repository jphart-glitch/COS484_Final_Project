The United States of America declared independence from Great Britain on July 2, 1776 (although the event is now commemorated on July 4, the date when the Declaration of Independence was officially adopted by Congress), in so doing becoming the first independent, foreign-recognized nation in the Americas and the first European colonial entity to break from its mother country. Britain formally acknowledged American independence in 1783 after its defeat in the American Revolutionary War. Although initially occupying only the land east of the Mississippi\nDocument [3](Title: American Revolution): second British army at Yorktown in the fall of 1781, effectively ending the war. The Treaty of Paris was signed September 3, 1783, formally ending the conflict and confirming the new nation's complete separation from the British Empire. The United States took possession of nearly all the territory east of the Mississippi River and south of the Great Lakes, with the British retaining control of Canada and Spain taking Florida. Among the significant results of the revolution was the creation of the United States Constitution, establishing a relatively strong federal national government that included an executive, a national judiciary, and\n\nAnswer:美国在1776年7月2日宣布从大不列颠独立，从而迈出了获得独立的第一步（尽管这一事件现在是在1776年7月4日纪念，也就是《独立宣言》正式被国会采纳的日期）[2]。后来，在1783年9月3日签署了《巴黎条约》，正式将美国从英国帝国中分离出来[3]。\n\n\nInstruction: Write an accurate, engaging, and concise answer in Chinese for the given question using only the provided search results (some of which might be irrelevant) and cite them properly.

            "output": "在离地面较远的地方引爆核弹比直接在地面引爆更具破坏性，因为空中爆炸可以产生更大的火球和压力波，同时产生的尘埃较少，不会被吸入火球中[1][2]。此外，空中爆炸可以产生较少的放射性尘埃，减少辐射污染的可能性[3]。"
