            "answer": "普通啤酒和黑啤酒的区别：1、颜色不同。黑啤的颜色呈棕色或焦黑色；普通啤酒呈淡黄色或棕黄色。2、原料不同。黑啤以黑麦芽作为原料烘烤发酵制作而成的；普通啤酒以小麦芽和大麦芽为主要原料，加啤酒花，经过液态糊化和糖化，再经过液态发酵酿制而成。3、口感不同。黑啤的口感偏甜，带焦香味，更为香醇；普通啤酒口味清爽而醇和。【2】淡啤酒和普通啤酒的区别：1.相比较于传统啤酒，淡啤酒的卡路里含量要少。相同含量的传统啤酒和淡啤酒，淡啤酒的卡路里含量至少要比普通啤酒的卡路里含量少三分之一。主要原因是淡啤酒中的酒精和糖分较少。 2.相比较于传统啤酒，淡啤酒的酒精含量要少。大多数啤酒的酒精含量普遍低于百分之五，这其中也包括淡啤酒。 3.相比较于传统啤酒，淡啤酒的卡路里和酒精含量要少，而有些虽然卡路里较少，但仍然具有与其原始啤酒酿造相同的酒精含量。 4.相比较于传统啤酒，淡啤酒的消费量更高。因为与普通啤酒相比，淡啤酒饮用者需要更长时间才能感受到酒精的影响。 5.相比较于传统啤酒，淡啤酒的酿造方式并不一样。因为淡啤酒的酒精含量相对较少，所以在口感和风味方面，与传统啤酒相比，淡啤酒的口感和风味有所减少。 6.相比较于常规啤酒，年轻的青少年和女性饮酒爱好者更加青睐于淡啤酒，而男性饮酒爱好者相对来说更加喜欢常规啤酒。【3】",
